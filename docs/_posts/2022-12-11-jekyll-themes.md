## It Ain't the Simplest
### (But then again, when is it ever?)

There's definitely a reason people use pre-built themes for this kind of thing. I looked through a few tutorials, and it's going to take a minute to make my own theme, but it's at least similar to building a regular site, just really focused on templating as much as possible and not hard-coding a bunch of stuff.
